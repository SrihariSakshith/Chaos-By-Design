## **Description**  

This website is a deliberately **horrible** example of UI/UX design, created for the **"Chaos by Design"** challenge. Its sole purpose is to **frustrate and annoy** users through **intentionally bad** design principles—while still remaining technically functional.  

💀 **Warning:** _This project is an **anti-pattern showcase**—DO NOT use it as a template for real projects unless you want to be banned from web design forever._

⚠️ _Visit at your own risk! You have been warned._

## **Key Frustrating Features**  

🔹 **Horrendous Aesthetics** – Uses **Comic Sans MS**, **eye-searing colors**, and **general visual chaos**.  

🎉 **Confetti Overload** – Endless confetti rains down, constantly **distracting the user**.  

🔄 **Rotating Navigation** – Navigation links rotate on hover, making them **impossible to click**.  

📦 **Randomly Moving Content** – Text **refuses to stay still** and moves randomly around the screen.  

🐱 **Unremovable Kitten Image** – A kitten image **evades the mouse cursor**, ensuring it **cannot be removed**.  

🚪 **Impossible Form Submission** – Clicking the submit button results in **sarcastic alerts**, **random redirections**, or **nothing at all**. Your message? **Lost in the void.**  

🦠 **Accessibility Nightmares** – **Ugly focus outlines**, **terrible color contrast**, and **zero usability**.  

📱 **Responsive Chaos** – On smaller screens, the design **amplifies the frustration**.  

🔄 **Annoying Animations** – Everything **spins, shakes, or jumps** for absolutely no reason.

## **UI/UX Anti-Patterns Used**  

✔️ **Comic Sans MS** – The most **infamous** font ever.  

❌ **Inconsistent Navigation** – Buttons **move, rotate**, and **disappear** at will.  

⚠️ **Poor Color Contrast** – Text is **barely readable** due to terrible contrast choices.  

🎭 **Unnecessary Animations** – Random **rotations, bounces, and flickers**.  

🎯 **Obstructed Interactions** – Elements **move away** from the cursor.  

🌀 **False Affordances** – Buttons _look_ clickable, but do **absolutely nothing**.  

🔥 **Zero Error Handling** – **No helpful feedback**, just chaos.  

🔗 **Orphan Pages** – Links lead to **nowhere** or **irrelevant** pages.  

🚨 **Non-Standard UI Controls** – Buttons and links **behave unpredictably**.
