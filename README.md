Chaos by Design: The Ultimate Frustration Machine - README
Description

This website is a deliberately terrible example of UI/UX design, created for the "Chaos by Design" challenge. Its purpose is to frustrate and annoy users through intentionally broken design principles while remaining technically functional. Do not use this as a template for real projects!

Key Frustrating Features

Horrendous Aesthetics: Uses Comic Sans MS font, eye-searing color combinations, and generally unpleasant visual elements.

Confetti Overload: Constant confetti raining down to distract the user.

Rotating Navigation: Navigation links rotate on hover, making them difficult to click.

Randomly Moving Content: Text elements move randomly around the screen.

Unremovable Image: A kitten image that stubbornly avoids the mouse cursor, making it impossible to "remove".

Impossible Form Submission: The contact form appears to function, but clicking the submit button will only result in sarcastic alert messages or random website redirections. No actual data is ever submitted.

Accessibility Nightmares: Focus outlines are intentionally ugly, and color contrast is poor in places.

Responsive Chaos: While somewhat responsive, the design amplifies the frustrating elements on smaller screens.

Annoying Animations: Constant rotation and other visual distractions.

Technical Details

Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Framework-Free: No external libraries or frameworks were used.

Purposefully Bad Design: The code prioritizes frustrating the user over usability.

How to Use

Save the HTML code as a .html file (e.g., chaos.html).

Open the file in a web browser.

Experience the carefully crafted frustration.
